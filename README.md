# 🎙️ VoiceBridge: Learning Assistance for Special Kids

When children start learning, they usually do so by observing their surroundings. For children with visual impairments, observation is replaced by **hearing**. Different sounds help them identify and understand the environment around them. For example, the sound of hammering may indicate nearby construction.  

**VoiceBridge** is an **interactive educational desktop application** developed using **C# and Windows Forms**, designed to help visually impaired children learn through **sound-based interaction**. It offers audio-based quizzes and engaging activities that use sound recognition to promote learning in a fun and intuitive way.
